sThis paper presents a Systematic Mapping (SM)  \cite{Petersen:2008} 
about the deign of service-oriented applications in the presence of
non-functional requirements. SM is a  method for analyzing a field of interest (e.g., service oriented applications and NFR). The analysis can focus on
periodicity of publications organized by categories called facets combined to
answer  specific research questions  \cite{Budgen:2008}  that a scientist wishes to answer with quantitative data generated through the SM steps. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:background} gives
the background about NFR and service oriented applications. Section \ref{sec:mappingprocess}  describes the systematic mapping
process and our research protocol, including the search strategy and selection of papers. Section \ref{sec:outcomes} presents and interpretes the analytics results.
Section \ref{sec:conclusions} concludes the paper and discusses research perspectives.
