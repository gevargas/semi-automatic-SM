With respect to the systematic mapping, we think that it requires a qualitative perspective that can be added by explicitly adding filtering and clustering criteria related to the provenance of the papers, the impact factor of the conference/journal where they appear, the reputation of the authors (given for example by their H factor), the institution and country of the authors. Without discarding the quantitative analysis, adding these criteria could increase the quality and value of the analysis. Similarly, we feel that choosing key words in the second phase of the methodology can be empirical, using vocabularies of the knowledge domain, could help to have a more representative choice. We are currently working in providing tools that can help to add quality to the systematic mapping method.
